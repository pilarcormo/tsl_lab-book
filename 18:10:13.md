## Today

1. I have updated rearrangement_methods.md with figure titles for each graph/plot and edited some of the discussion

2. Went back to fragments_w_snps.rb to test whether my snp positions are in a true normal distribution:

- I discovered that the Shapiroâ€“Wilk test can be used in R, to determine whether the sample of SNP positions I used are normally distributed

- Run fragments_w_snps.rb which now generates a text file of the snp positions, then source normality_test.txt in R and finally type in the command: shapiro.test(snp_pos)

- This revealed that the p value for the Shapiro-Wilk test was consistently much higher than 0.05, meaning we DO NOT reject the null hypothesis that this IS a normal distribution. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shapiro%E2%80%93Wilk_test 

## Next

- Look at the answer to your question on stack, and decide what to do about determining the highest possible score. Then write up.

## Later on...

- Way down the line: test different midpoints for your rearranged distribution to be around; this could be after you already have a rearrangement method that works when we know the midpoint is in the middle. Write a method that uses that rearrangement method multiple times, with different midpoints, to find the best one, and therefore estimate the mutant position.
