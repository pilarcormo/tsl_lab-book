 commit: 'rearrangement methods 3'
 repo: fragmented_genome_with_snps

I tried out more methods for rearranging the fragments (remember SCORE: 0 means the order is the same as original):

### METHOD 9:  new_order 		     SCORE: 51,668 
### METHOD 10: left_right_method3    SCORE: 42,972 
### METHOD 11: snp_ids_density_order SCORE: 60,750 
### METHOD 12: rearranged3			 SCORE: 56,212 

- The above methods are the main ones I tried today. Since I have no way of rearranging the fragments with zero snps yet, I carried out methods for just the snp containing frags, compared against the order in vcf (unique only).

- Method 11 is the new base marker, anything should do better than this.

- See the file for more information on what each method does, suffice to say, they are all far from achieving the goal of rearranging the fragments into the correct order.

- Method 9 and 10 rely on the information of whether each fragment has a higher number of snps on it's 'left' or 'right' hand side. This is used to determine which side of the centre, the frag should go in the order - (the normal distribution).
The part of the code used to determine which frags go on the left or right is at lines 91-112:
#this whole section would be unuseable as it relies on fasta_ids and fasta_lengths to determine left and right lists
#you could try and write code to get left and right from the density order, but there would be little point now
# - we have already seen that the left_right method is far from accurate

Additional information:

The fragments couldn't be assembled by overlapping, they don't overlap.
