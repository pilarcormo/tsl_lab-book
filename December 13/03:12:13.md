========================================================

**From now on, each day after tea break do some work on literature review OR read calculus/statistics R**

### Today

- Proved that the fragment with the highest SNP density doesn't have the causative mutation

### Next

1. Try and work out why exactly the centre of the normal dist is not where the mutation is

2. Finish the forward mutation screen bit of literature review
 - Read up on [NGM](http://bar.utoronto.ca/ngm/description.html)

2. Read other papers for the SNP calling mapping based/background section, lit review

3. Work out how to use rdoc, and do documentation for key ruby files

### Later on

2. Make a better rearrangement method: linear programming?

3. Test different midpoints for your rearranged distribution to be around; this could be after you already have a rearrangement method that works when we know the midpoint is in the middle. Write a method that uses that rearrangement method multiple times, with different midpoints, to find the best one, and therefore estimate the mutant position.

4. Eventually you will need to modify density_method_testa.rb to work with any ARGV file, and of course the file containing the rearrangement/mutation locating algorithm, saving the files in an appropriate location
