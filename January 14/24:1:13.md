========================================================

### Today

- Fixed het_hom method issue in reform_ratio

- Added "mini_mutate" method

- Updated the README to have information on the entire project

### Main

1. See if the GA will work now

1. Add peak finding into reform_ratio.rb

1. Update Basecamp! Do this first thing!

2. Continue Calculus for 2 hours a day, e.g. after tea break

1. Continue to update the README with info that will be useful for your talk and general understanding.

2. Make sure the GA works for a variety of distributions: 
 - Test the GA against different distributions in the qq plot, e.g. a **theoretical distribution**
 - contig/fragment sizes: we can test different sizes, sizes are down to experimental choice.


### Other

2. Read other papers for the SNP calling mapping based/background section, lit review

### Possibly

3. Possibly: use rdoc, and do documentation for key ruby files, but need to classify them first

3. For a succesful rearrangement method that only recognises a normal distribution in the middle of the genome: Test different midpoints for your rearranged distribution to be around; this could be after you already have a rearrangement method that works when we know the midpoint is in the middle. Write a method that uses that rearrangement method multiple times, with different midpoints, to find the best one, and therefore estimate the mutant position.
 - This isn't neccesary if the GA will work with a theoretical distribution in the qq plot
