## Today

Started collecting references for a literature review:

1. State of the art and shortcomings of the filed I am working in
 - SNP detection with NGS
 - de novo methods for SNP calling in Bioinformatics
 
2. See references_quotes.md in lit_review_snp_detection_calling

## Next

- Carry on reading background literature for lit review

- Come up with new fragment rearrangement methods: think about linear programming and how you used it to work out the max score

## Later on...

- Way down the line: test different midpoints for your rearranged distribution to be around; this could be after you already have a rearrangement method that works when we know the midpoint is in the middle. Write a method that uses that rearrangement method multiple times, with different midpoints, to find the best one, and therefore estimate the mutant position.
