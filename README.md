Research objective
----

In the detection of causative mutations from high-throughput sequencing sets, I will be working on an algorithm that sorts and arranges paths and bubbles (nascent contigs with classified SNPs) in the de Bruijn graph data structure context, to maximise the assumptions of allele frequency distribution expected from genetic outcrossing.
