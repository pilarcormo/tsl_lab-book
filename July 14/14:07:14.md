### Recently

- Tested max_density and max_ratio fitness methods

### Next
 
4. Re-run the experiment in the cluster
 - Analyse the results
 
4. Modify the gifs:
 - Background of correct permutation, with moving permutations on top
 - Both fitness methods in different colours for comparison?

3. Write up how to run entire experiment, with file names etc so reproducible
 - what fitness methods and metrics do exactly
 - flowcharts of the genetic algorithm

### Eventually

2. **Find a suitable distribution for real EMS backcross experiment SNPs** if using the older fitness method

3. Write code that can separate homozygous and heterozygous SNPs from a VCF file from real data: add this to ReformRatio - *this is probably beyond the project scope*

4. Add peak finding to genetic algorithm
