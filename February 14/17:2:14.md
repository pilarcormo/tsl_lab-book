### This week

Merged the ratio branch of fragmented genome repo with the master. Algorithm can now be run easily on desktop with instructions in the README.

### Next

1. Make the algorithm "cluster friendly" in cluster branch of repo:
 - Ask Dan/Graham about how it works and how/where to save output files
 - Remove all screen print messages?
 
5. Test the GA for a variety of parameters, distributions and fragment sizes (datasets) on the cluster

3. Consider looking at the best recombinant, mutant and save in each generation to see which of these is contributing to the best

4. Generate some kind of visual representation of the best permutation's similarity to original order (ask about this)

### Eventually

6. Understand maths behind peak finding, and use peak finding in R: add to GA

7. Update README further with the "Purpose of Project" and "Peak Finding" sections

2. Use rdoc, and do documentation for key ruby files.

3. Make ruby gems for the project, a simple class with things like write_txt, my own genetic algorithm?
