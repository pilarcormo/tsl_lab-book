========================================================

### Today

1. Written up all plots for skew method

2. Decided that the skew method doesn't work

3. Started collating sources for literature review: genetic screens and mutation induced phenotypes (e.g. disease resistance in plants)

### Next

1. Talk to Dan about skew method

2. Write a bit of the literature review about forward genetics etc.
 - get more sources if you want

### Later on

1. Collate and read more papers for the literature review

2. Write the review

2. Make a better rearrangement method: linear programming?

3. Test different midpoints for your rearranged distribution to be around; this could be after you already have a rearrangement method that works when we know the midpoint is in the middle. Write a method that uses that rearrangement method multiple times, with different midpoints, to find the best one, and therefore estimate the mutant position.

4. Eventually you will need to modify density_method_testa.rb to work with any ARGV file, and of course the file containing the rearrangement/mutation locating algorithm, saving the files in an appropriate location
