========================================================

**From now on, each day after tea break do some work on literature review OR read calculus/statistics R**

### Today

1. Sorted out problem with [skew_scatta.rb](https://github.com/edwardchalstrey1/fragmented_genome_with_snps/blob/master/skew_scatta.rb)

1. Continued writing up the distance method in [part 4 rearrangement methods](https://github.com/edwardchalstrey1/fragmented_genome_with_snps/blob/master/writeup/p4_rearrangement_methods.md)

### Next

2. On Tuesday: finish the forward mutation screen bit of literature review
 - Read up on [NGM](http://bar.utoronto.ca/ngm/description.html)

2. New version of the model genome that models arabidopsis that has been mutation bred

3. Keep reading the calculus pdf

2. Continue writing the literature review plan, then review:
 - Read other papers for the SNP calling mapping based/background section

### Later on

2. Make a better rearrangement method: linear programming?

3. Test different midpoints for your rearranged distribution to be around; this could be after you already have a rearrangement method that works when we know the midpoint is in the middle. Write a method that uses that rearrangement method multiple times, with different midpoints, to find the best one, and therefore estimate the mutant position.

4. Eventually you will need to modify density_method_testa.rb to work with any ARGV file, and of course the file containing the rearrangement/mutation locating algorithm, saving the files in an appropriate location
