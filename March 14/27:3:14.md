### Today

- Started to re-run algorithm: It is currently running extremely slowly, because it has to generate the hypothetical snps array for every single permutation
- Have got code in place that can generate performance figures for the genetic algorithm
- Generated example plots for algorithm performance including circos

### Next

1. Generate simple dataset that can be used to run the genetic algorithm to completion multiple times, to test whether it works at all
 - Modify the model genome creation scripts so this can be done
 - Modify the genetic algorithm (fitness) so that permutations can be tested against an example distribution of your choice, this can be switched between the 10K_Datasets, tiny test datasets, and eventually real datasets

2. When hyp2 run of 10K_dataset1 for genetic algorithm finishes, generate the metric figures (and circos plot if it looks good), then writeup results

3. If the genetic algorithm correctly re-orders contigs , then we can write up that the genetic algorithm idea works, with a fitness method that used the hom/het snp density ratio
 - ... then, it will be a case of finding a suitable distibution approximation for the Q-Q plot with real data

### Eventually

2. Parallelize the algorithm: perhaps use the parallel gem
 - **No need to worry about this until after you have the fitness method that really works!**
 - This will probably only be neccesary if you want to run it in the cluster

6. Understand maths behind peak finding, and use peak finding in R: add to GA

7. Update README further with the "Purpose of Project" and "Peak Finding" sections

2. Use rdoc, and do documentation for key ruby files.

3. Make ruby **gems** for the project: GATOC and permutation metrics
