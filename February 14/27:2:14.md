========================================================

### This week

- Made circos plots of the genetic algorithms performance
- Ran the algorithm multiple times with default settings for 100 generations
- Generated performance figures and [wrote up](https://github.com/edwardchalstrey1/fragmented_genome_with_snps/blob/master/Progress/Ratio_Distribution.md)
- Identified problem with the existing fitness method as a way of telling how well the distribution is re-created

### Next

1. Work on the optimal solution for testing to see if fragments in the correct order

1. Work on a new version of the fitness method, that can place the peak in the distribution in the right place

2. Parallelize the algorithm: perhaps use the parallel gem
 - **No need to worry about this until after you have the fitness method that really works!**
 - This will probably only be neccesary if you want to run it in the cluster


### Eventually

6. Understand maths behind peak finding, and use peak finding in R: add to GA

7. Update README further with the "Purpose of Project" and "Peak Finding" sections

2. Use rdoc, and do documentation for key ruby files.

3. Make ruby **gems** for the project, a simple class with things like write_txt, my own genetic algorithm?
