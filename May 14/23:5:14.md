========================================================

### This week

- Restarted all cluster runs
- Created script for testing the distributions, fitness, and metric scores of permutations close to the correct, and randomly ordered permutations
- Changed quit condition of algorithm to slope

### Next

1. Run examples_close_to_correct_permutation.rb for 10K_dataset3, each div

1. Document everything

2. Why is drone.io failing?

2. **Work on big scatter plot of all runs**

3. Use imagemagick to create .gif of snp distributions over generations

3. Maybe: Add near swap method to PMeth - adjacent objects swap position. Add this into genetic algorithm

4. Run some more instances of the algorithm in the cluster

7. **Find a suitable distribution for real EMS backcross experiment SNPs**

8. Write code that can separate homozygous and heterozygous SNPs from a VCF file from real data: add this to ReformRatio

### Extra analysis

3. (not essential) - fix code for making plot of which reproduction method works best, test on small_dataset2 results (use unit tests)

2. Update gg-plots to be single figures, with all metrics, but faceted, on same scale if possible (different colours for different metrics)

### Eventually

1. Understand maths behind peak finding, and use peak finding in R: add to GA

2. Update README further with the "Purpose of Project" and "Peak Finding" sections

3. Use rdoc, and do documentation for key ruby files.
