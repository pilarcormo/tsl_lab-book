### Today

- Changed the [model genome](https://github.com/edwardchalstrey1/fragmented_genome_with_snps/blob/normal/lib/arabidopsis_c4_w_snps.rb) to have [10K hom snps normally distributed and 10K het snps uniformly distributed](https://github.com/edwardchalstrey1/fragmented_genome_with_snps/tree/normal/arabidopsis_datasets/10K_dataset1), creating a [slash distribution](https://github.com/edwardchalstrey1/fragmented_genome_with_snps/blob/normal/Progress/Slash/Slash.md)
- Implemented new hypothetical SNPs idea as a measure of Ratio
- Started to re-run algorithm: It is currently running extremely slowly, because it has to generate the hypothetical snps array for every single permutation

### Next

1. Write up the hypothetical SNP positions idea for ratio, with examples from [test](https://github.com/edwardchalstrey1/fragmented_genome_with_snps/tree/normal/test/hypothetical_snps)

2. When genetic algorithm finishes, generate the metric figures (and circos plot if it looks good), then writeup results

3. If the genetic algorithm, then we can write up that the genetic algorithm idea works, with a fitness method that used the hom/het snp density ratio
 - ... then, it will be a case of finding a suitable distibution approximation for the Q-Q plot with real data

### Eventually

2. Parallelize the algorithm: perhaps use the parallel gem
 - **No need to worry about this until after you have the fitness method that really works!**
 - This will probably only be neccesary if you want to run it in the cluster

6. Understand maths behind peak finding, and use peak finding in R: add to GA

7. Update README further with the "Purpose of Project" and "Peak Finding" sections

2. Use rdoc, and do documentation for key ruby files.

3. Make ruby **gems** for the project: GATOC and permutation metrics
