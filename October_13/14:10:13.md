## Today

- Tried to work out the rearrangement method that gives the highest possible "score". I think that the reversed original order is it!

- **Bar plot**: moved png of plot into the same folder as the md file, so it displays on github

## Next

- Determine whether you are correct about the reversed original order giving the **highest score**

- Include **error bars** for the random control in the bar plot (will need to update the random score method): need the data to export from ruby, to Rstudio

- Create **scatter plots** of all the fragments for each method, density on Y axis. Also the left and right lists individually

- Use 'write latex'/'mac latex' for making the ord sim **maths png**, then insert this into the markdown

- Use a **qq plot** to test normal distribution of sampled snp positions in fragments_w_snps.rb

- Come up with **new rearrangement methods**

- Make **bar plot** neater and rename the png with an informative filename: don't worry about this until you are finished with rearrangement methods, as putting the file into the correct place then commiting to github for every change would be a hassle.

## Later on...

- Way down the line: test different midpoints for your rearranged distribution to be around; this could be after you already have a rearrangement method that works when we know the midpoint is in the middle. Write a method that uses that rearrangement method multiple times, with different midpoints, to find the best one, and therefore estimate the mutant position.
