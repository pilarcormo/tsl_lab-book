========================================================

**From now on, each day after tea break do some work on literature review OR read calculus/statistics R**

### Today

- Used ggplot 2 histograms in skew scatta (how scatta) to confirm that skew method is shit.

- Read more about NGM (austin et al), discovered that the number of SNPs in the non-recombint region in their experiment is really low
 - see the supporting table 3 in documents/articles

### Next

3. make the model genome accurate
 - Need to review how your "mini project" relates to what is described in linear_prog.docx, it is probably **not the same as NGM experiment**
 - ngm paper: not just SNPs, **homozygous SNPs**, if you think you should be doing this low number of snps in austin et al, ask Dan for help
 - look for an appropriate standard deviation!!
 - then obviously modify the model genome as appropriate

1. Try and work out why exactly the centre of the normal dist is not where the mutation is
 - This may not be a real problem, but generate datasets of equal frag size to check

4. AND THEN try and get a rearrangement method/ mutation detection algorithm

2. Read other papers for the SNP calling mapping based/background section, lit review

3. Possibly: use rdoc, and do documentation for key ruby files, but need to classify them first

### Later on

2. Make a better rearrangement method: linear programming?

3. Test different midpoints for your rearranged distribution to be around; this could be after you already have a rearrangement method that works when we know the midpoint is in the middle. Write a method that uses that rearrangement method multiple times, with different midpoints, to find the best one, and therefore estimate the mutant position.

4. Eventually you will need to modify density_method_testa.rb to work with any ARGV file, and of course the file containing the rearrangement/mutation locating algorithm, saving the files in an appropriate location
