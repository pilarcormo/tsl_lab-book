========================================================

**From now on, each day after tea break do some work on literature review OR read calculus/statistics R**

### Today

- Had a look at why the mutant is on a different frag to the centre of the SNP distribution, still not sure why?

- Read a bit about NGM, wrote a bit of lit review

- Had a look at rdoc

### Next

1. Try and work out why exactly the centre of the normal dist is not where the mutation is
 - you may need help with this
 
2. Talk to Dan about where to go next, since the skew method doesn't work

2. Read other papers for the SNP calling mapping based/background section, lit review

3. Possibly: use rdoc, and do documentation for key ruby files, but need to classify them first

### Later on

2. Make a better rearrangement method: linear programming?

3. Test different midpoints for your rearranged distribution to be around; this could be after you already have a rearrangement method that works when we know the midpoint is in the middle. Write a method that uses that rearrangement method multiple times, with different midpoints, to find the best one, and therefore estimate the mutant position.

4. Eventually you will need to modify density_method_testa.rb to work with any ARGV file, and of course the file containing the rearrangement/mutation locating algorithm, saving the files in an appropriate location
