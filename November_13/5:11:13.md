Today
----

- Edited [skew_scatta.R](https://github.com/edwardchalstrey1/fragmented_genome_with_snps/blob/master/skew_scatta.R) to used Kernel Density estimate, but it doesn't work yet, see the annotations

- Did [plan for literature review](https://github.com/edwardchalstrey1/lit_review_snp_detection_calling/blob/master/lit_review_plan.md)

This week
----

- Continue to research/write literature review

- Each time you use a reference, use the method that Dan showed you/ look up easy references write latex

Later
-----

- Include R code (or links to script preferably) in [rearrangement methods](https://github.com/edwardchalstrey1/fragmented_genome_with_snps/blob/master/writeup/rearrangement_methods.md) and [part2](https://github.com/edwardchalstrey1/fragmented_genome_with_snps/blob/master/writeup/p2_rearrangement_methods.md), you will need to look at older commits of [skew_scatta.R](https://github.com/edwardchalstrey1/fragmented_genome_with_snps/blob/master/skew_scatta.R) before 4/11/13. Also check that the other R scripts have not changed since they generated graphs

- see **Fragment Rearrangement** in [31st.md](https://github.com/edwardchalstrey1/tsl_lab-book/blob/master/October_13/31:10:13.md)
