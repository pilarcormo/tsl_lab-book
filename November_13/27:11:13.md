========================================================

**From now on, each day after tea break do some wotk on literature review OR read calculus/statistics R**

### Today

1. Continued doing/ wrote up the distance method in [skew_scatta.rb](https://github.com/edwardchalstrey1/fragmented_genome_with_snps/blob/master/skew_scatta.rb)/[skew_scatter.R](https://github.com/edwardchalstrey1/fragmented_genome_with_snps/blob/master/skew_scatter.R)/[part 4 rearrangement methods](https://github.com/edwardchalstrey1/fragmented_genome_with_snps/blob/master/writeup/p4_rearrangement_methods.md)

### Next

1. Talk to Dan about findings on skew scatter

2. New version of the model genome that models arabidopsis that has been mutation bred

2. Continue writing the literature review plan, then review:
 - Read up on [NGM](http://bar.utoronto.ca/ngm/description.html)
 - Read other papers for the SNP calling mapping based/background section

### Later on

2. Make a better rearrangement method: linear programming?

3. Test different midpoints for your rearranged distribution to be around; this could be after you already have a rearrangement method that works when we know the midpoint is in the middle. Write a method that uses that rearrangement method multiple times, with different midpoints, to find the best one, and therefore estimate the mutant position.

4. Eventually you will need to modify density_method_testa.rb to work with any ARGV file, and of course the file containing the rearrangement/mutation locating algorithm, saving the files in an appropriate location
