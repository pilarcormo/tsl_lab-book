### Today

1. Continued doing the distance method in [skew_scatta.rb](https://github.com/edwardchalstrey1/fragmented_genome_with_snps/blob/master/skew_scatta.rb)/[skew_scatter.R](https://github.com/edwardchalstrey1/fragmented_genome_with_snps/blob/master/skew_scatter.R)

### Next

1. Make a version of the distance method for skew functionality determination, that uses a **linear relationship of density to distance of base from SNP** as oppose to the current exponential one. [test](https://github.com/edwardchalstrey1/fragmented_genome_with_snps/blob/master/test_diff_dist_dens.rb)
 - You can have both density methods in the same file!! just call them separately

1. Continue writing up the distance method for skew functionality determination

0. Read up on [NGM](http://bar.utoronto.ca/ngm/description.html)

2. New version of the model genome that models arabidopsis that has been mutation bred

2. Continue writing the literature review plan, then review: What are SNPs/ SNP calling/ Standard reference based tools
 - Write about SAMTools
 - Know about other standard tools

### Later on

2. Make a better rearrangement method: linear programming?

3. Test different midpoints for your rearranged distribution to be around; this could be after you already have a rearrangement method that works when we know the midpoint is in the middle. Write a method that uses that rearrangement method multiple times, with different midpoints, to find the best one, and therefore estimate the mutant position.

4. Eventually you will need to modify density_method_testa.rb to work with any ARGV file, and of course the file containing the rearrangement/mutation locating algorithm, saving the files in an appropriate location
