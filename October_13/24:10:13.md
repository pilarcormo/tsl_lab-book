========================================================

I sorted out github folders in fragmented... repo, and started researching for literature review

To do's
=======

- Make the corrections Dan suggested for rearrangement_methods.md

### Fragment rearragement

- Sort out github folders

- Try to do a linear programming method

- You have the fasta/vcf used for the current methods saved, try and get breaks that are smaller/equal to fragment size, then make new fasta/vcf and try the methods again

### Literature review

- Ask Dan about what he said in his e-mail

- Carry on reading legget et al

- Carry on researching the field

## Later on...

- Way down the line: test different midpoints for your rearranged distribution to be around; this could be after you already have a rearrangement method that works when we know the midpoint is in the middle. Write a method that uses that rearrangement method multiple times, with different midpoints, to find the best one, and therefore estimate the mutant position.
