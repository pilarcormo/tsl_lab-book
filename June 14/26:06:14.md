### Recently

- Gifs of change in SNP ratio over generations (best perms)
- Flowchart of evolve method
- Results plots

### Next

2. Implement new fitness method

3. Test how well fitness method shows 'close to correct' permutations to have a good score

4. Test how well the distance metrics show 'close to correct' permutations to have a good score

3. Re-run the experiment in the cluster
 - Optimize it first? Would adding data directly to one csv file be faster than via .txts

4. Finish complimentary flowcharts for sub-methods

5. Document how the experiment works, start to finish, with information on how to run everything, and what the inputs/outputs are etc

### Eventually

1. Update metric plots from cluster job of making the csv for 10K_dataset4

1. Maybe: Add near swap method to PMeth - adjacent objects swap position. Add this into genetic algorithm

2. **Find a suitable distribution for real EMS backcross experiment SNPs**

3. Write code that can separate homozygous and heterozygous SNPs from a VCF file from real data: add this to ReformRatio

4. Add peak finding to genetic algorithm
