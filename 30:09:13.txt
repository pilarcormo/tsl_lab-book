 commit: 'rearrangement methods'
 repo: fragmented_genome_with_snps

- Added a couple of rearrangement methods for the fragments:
	#see file for method details#
### METHOD 1: frags_by_density SCORE: 398,988	density order
### METHOD 2: rearranged       SCORE: 585,252	even/odd method
### METHOD 3: rearranged2      SCORE: 403,162	somehow worse

- Method 3 didn't work as expected. I expected that moving the fragments with zero snps from the end of the original order, to the end, should give a higher score.

- Looked up linear programming, still not found how to use this to rearrange my fragments by SNP density.
