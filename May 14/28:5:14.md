========================================================

### This week

- Restarted all cluster runs
- Created script for testing the distributions, fitness, and metric scores of permutations close to the correct, and randomly ordered permutations
- Changed quit condition of algorithm to slope

### Next

1. Change fitness score to compare count ratio against permutation count ratio (regression)
 - binned intervals frequency of heterozygous to homozygous SNPs

1. Update all files that use the fitness including figure creation etc

2. Create new algorithm quit condition, based on Rieman sum
 - every x generations take the area under the curve of improvement
 - if the area is less than n% bigger than the previous, then end the algorithm (negligible improvement)
 
3. Run a new batch of jobs in the hpc

1. Document everything!!!
 - New fitness and quit condition
 - How to run everything in README

2. Why is drone.io failing?

2. **Work on big plot of all runs**
 - Need a way of monitoring progress on all runs
 - Ideally with bands, and all runs faceted on same/several plots (different plots for different population sizes?)

3. Flow chart of experiment
 - Write neatly on paper, use colour

3. Use imagemagick to create .gif of snp distributions over generations

3. Maybe: Add near swap method to PMeth - adjacent objects swap position. Add this into genetic algorithm

4. Run some more instances of the algorithm in the cluster

7. **Find a suitable distribution for real EMS backcross experiment SNPs**

8. Write code that can separate homozygous and heterozygous SNPs from a VCF file from real data: add this to ReformRatio

### Extra analysis

3. (not essential) - fix code for making plot of which reproduction method works best, test on small_dataset2 results (use unit tests)

2. Update gg-plots to be single figures, with all metrics, but faceted, on same scale if possible (different colours for different metrics)

### Eventually

1. Understand maths behind peak finding, and use peak finding in R: add to GA

2. Update README further with the "Purpose of Project" and "Peak Finding" sections

3. Use rdoc, and do documentation for key ruby files.
