========================================================

### This week

- Changed fitness score to compare count ratio against permutation count ratio - documented
- Updated all files that use the fitness including figure creatio
- Created new algorithm quit condition and documented
- Ran a new batch of jobs in the hpc

### Next

2. Why is drone.io failing?

2. **Work on big plot of all runs**
 - Need a way of monitoring progress on all runs
 - Ideally with bands, and all runs faceted on same/several plots (different plots for different population sizes?)

3. Flow chart of experiment
 - Write neatly on paper, use colour

3. Use imagemagick to create .gif of snp distributions over generations

3. Maybe: Add near swap method to PMeth - adjacent objects swap position. Add this into genetic algorithm

4. Run some more instances of the algorithm in the cluster

7. **Find a suitable distribution for real EMS backcross experiment SNPs**

8. Write code that can separate homozygous and heterozygous SNPs from a VCF file from real data: add this to ReformRatio

### Extra analysis

3. (not essential) - fix code for making plot of which reproduction method works best, test on small_dataset2 results (use unit tests)

2. Update gg-plots to be single figures, with all metrics, but faceted, on same scale if possible (different colours for different metrics)

### Eventually

1. Understand maths behind peak finding, and use peak finding in R: add to GA

2. Update README further with the "Purpose of Project" and "Peak Finding" sections

3. Use rdoc, and do documentation for key ruby files.
