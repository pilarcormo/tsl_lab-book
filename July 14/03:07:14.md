========================================================

### Recently

- Tested how well fitness method shows 'close to correct' permutations to have a good score
- Tested how well distance metrics show 'close to correct' permutations to have a good score
- Made flowcharts for fitness, selection and new population
- Added adjacent_swap method to PMeth gem
- Added un-normalized versions of each distance metric to PDist gem

### Next

1. Run 10,000 adjacent swaps for the metrics and add to markdown

1. Make a branch of the project that uses the new fitness method
 - run some tests with the small dataset
 - create the gifs

3. Re-run the experiment in the cluster
 - Optimize it first? Would adding data directly to one csv file be faster than via .txts
 
4. Modify the gifs:
 - Background of correct permutation, with moving permutations on top
 - Both fitness methods in different colours for comparison?

3. Add a geom_line of best permutation in each generation to umbrealla plots

3. Write up how to run entire experiment, with file names etc so reproducible
 - what fitness methods and metrics do exactly
 - flowcharts of the genetic algorithm

### Eventually

2. **Find a suitable distribution for real EMS backcross experiment SNPs** if using the older fitness method

3. Write code that can separate homozygous and heterozygous SNPs from a VCF file from real data: add this to ReformRatio - *this is probably beyond the project scope*

4. Add peak finding to genetic algorithm
