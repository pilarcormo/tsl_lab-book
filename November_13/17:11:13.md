========================================================

**From now on, assign yourself a paper to read each day in Mendeley**

### Today

1. Continued collating sources for literature review, [updated plan](https://github.com/edwardchalstrey1/lit_review_snp_detection_calling/blob/master/plan2.md)

2. Wrote the [forward genetics](https://www.writelatex.com/476316sfhjrn) section of review

### Next

1. Talk to Dan about skew method

2. Continue writing the literature review plan, then review: What are SNPs/ SNP calling/ Standard reference based tools
 - Write about SAMTools
 - Know about other standard tools

### Later on

2. Make a better rearrangement method: linear programming?

3. Test different midpoints for your rearranged distribution to be around; this could be after you already have a rearrangement method that works when we know the midpoint is in the middle. Write a method that uses that rearrangement method multiple times, with different midpoints, to find the best one, and therefore estimate the mutant position.

4. Eventually you will need to modify density_method_testa.rb to work with any ARGV file, and of course the file containing the rearrangement/mutation locating algorithm, saving the files in an appropriate location
