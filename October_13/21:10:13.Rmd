### commit

see all commits from 21st October

## Today

- Worked out the maximum score that a rearrangement method can get (minimum ordinal similarity to original order)

- Added a figure explaining how I worked out the fragment arrangement that minimises the ordinal similarity to original order

- See rearrangement_methods.md for deatils ^

## Next

- Come up with new rearrangement methods: think about linear programming and how you used it to work out the max score

## Later on...

- Way down the line: test different midpoints for your rearranged distribution to be around; this could be after you already have a rearrangement method that works when we know the midpoint is in the middle. Write a method that uses that rearrangement method multiple times, with different midpoints, to find the best one, and therefore estimate the mutant position.
