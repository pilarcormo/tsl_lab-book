### commit

see all commits from 16th-17th October

## Today

1. Updated scatter graphs

2. How to update scatter graphs/rearrangement plots in future quickly:

- Update the txt files (e.g. random_vector_Rcode.txt OR scatter_vectors.txt) with your changes

- Run the txt file(s) in R with: source("location/filename")

- Run git-those-pngs.sh which commits the changes for each graph

- Viewing rearrangement_methods.md will now show updated graphs

## Next

- Look at the answer to your question on stack, and decide what to do about determining the highest possible score. Then write up.

- Use 'write latex'/'mac latex' for making the ord sim **maths png**, then insert this into the markdown

- Use a **qq plot** to test normal distribution of sampled snp positions in fragments_w_snps.rb

- Come up with **new rearrangement methods**

- Make **bar plot** neater and rename the png with an informative filename: don't worry about this until you are finished with rearrangement methods, as putting the file into the correct place then commiting to github for every change would be a hassle.

## Later on...

- Way down the line: test different midpoints for your rearranged distribution to be around; this could be after you already have a rearrangement method that works when we know the midpoint is in the middle. Write a method that uses that rearrangement method multiple times, with different midpoints, to find the best one, and therefore estimate the mutant position.
