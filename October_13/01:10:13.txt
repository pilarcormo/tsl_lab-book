 commit: 'more rearrangement methods'
 repo: fragmented_genome_with_snps

- Continued rearrangement methods for the fragments: (refer to the files for a definition of the score)

### METHOD 1: frags_by_density    SCORE: 385,572	
### METHOD 2: rearranged          SCORE: 520,762	
### METHOD 3: rearranged2         SCORE: 166,972	
### METHOD 4*: left_right_method  SCORE: 155,496	
### METHOD 5*: left_right_method2 SCORE: 168,178 	

- Method 2: array of the even indexes of the density array, then the odd indexes reversed - so the frags with the highest density in middle
	This performed poorly as expected.

- Method 3 involved moving the frags with zero snps that were at the end of the original order to the end of the method 2 order.
	I did this for all subsequent methods. This would however not be possible if the fasta file was not in the original order.
	The fasta file needs to be in the original order at the moment, because 'scoring' the arrangement methods relies on comparing against the original order. This is something I will need to change eventually.

- Method 4 involved using rearrannging the fragments with more snps on the 'right hand side' to the left of the order, and vice versa.
	I did this because of the normal distribution, where snps should be closer to the centre. The frags with zero snps were arranged at the front and back of the order as in method 3.

- Method 5: I rearranged the 'left' and 'right' fragments from method 4 by density, then added the zero snp fragments as before.
	This method performed worse than method 4 surprisingly.
