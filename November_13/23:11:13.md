### Today

1. Continued doing the distance method in [skew_scatta.rb](https://github.com/edwardchalstrey1/fragmented_genome_with_snps/blob/master/skew_scatta.rb)/[skew_scatter.R](https://github.com/edwardchalstrey1/fragmented_genome_with_snps/blob/master/skew_scatter.R)

### Next

0. Read up on [NGM](http://bar.utoronto.ca/ngm/description.html)

1. Better version of the K density estimate that normalizes it for each fragment OR **distance between each SNP method for skew_scatta.R**
 - get the gradients right, then do the same plots
 - But first, lets tidy the script up

2. New version of the model genome that models arabidopsis that has been mutation bred

2. Continue writing the literature review plan, then review: What are SNPs/ SNP calling/ Standard reference based tools
 - Write about SAMTools
 - Know about other standard tools

### Later on

2. Make a better rearrangement method: linear programming?

3. Test different midpoints for your rearranged distribution to be around; this could be after you already have a rearrangement method that works when we know the midpoint is in the middle. Write a method that uses that rearrangement method multiple times, with different midpoints, to find the best one, and therefore estimate the mutant position.

4. Eventually you will need to modify density_method_testa.rb to work with any ARGV file, and of course the file containing the rearrangement/mutation locating algorithm, saving the files in an appropriate location
