### Recently

- Tested how well fitness method shows 'close to correct' permutations to have a good score
- Tested how well distance metrics show 'close to correct' permutations to have a good score
- Made flowcharts for fitness, selection and new population
- Added adjacent_swap method to PMeth gem
- Added un-normalized versions of each distance metric to PDist gem

### Next

2. Implement new fitness method idea

3. Add a geom_line of best permutation in each generation to umbrealla plots

3. Write up how to run entire experiment, with file names etc so reproducible
 - what fitness methods and metrics do exactly
 - flowcharts of the genetic algorithm

3. Re-run the experiment in the cluster
 - Optimize it first? Would adding data directly to one csv file be faster than via .txts

5. Document how the experiment works, start to finish, with information on how to run everything, and what the inputs/outputs are etc

### Eventually

2. **Find a suitable distribution for real EMS backcross experiment SNPs**

3. Write code that can separate homozygous and heterozygous SNPs from a VCF file from real data: add this to ReformRatio - *this is probably beyond the project scope*

4. Add peak finding to genetic algorithm
