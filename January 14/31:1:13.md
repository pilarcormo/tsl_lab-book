### This week

I now have a working genetic algorithm [reform_ratio.rb](https://github.com/edwardchalstrey1/fragmented_genome_with_snps/blob/ratio/reform_ratio.rb) that will create figures of the best permutation's snp ratio distribution across the genome, and the performance of the algorithm, with regard to the increase of fitness for each generation.

### Next

1. Run the GA over the weekend on laptop, to get better figures

1. **ON MONDAY** write your abstract for TSLAM. Start doing the powerpoint in following days. You want to be rehearsing wednesday and thursday night.

2. GA:
 - See what the correlation value is, and write this into the README and any future mention of it: r2 pearsons?
 - Consider looking at the best recombinant, mutant and save in each generation to see which of these is contributing to the best
 - Generate some kind of visual representation of the best permutation's similarity to original order (ask about this)
 
3. Remember to also do **Calculus** and **Classes/unit-test practice**

3. Look at basecamp for main list

### Eventually

1. Make the algorithm super neat, use classes where appropriate. Can do this for model generation script too.

2. Use rdoc, and do documentation for key ruby files.
