### This week

I now have a working genetic algorithm [reform_ratio.rb](https://github.com/edwardchalstrey1/fragmented_genome_with_snps/blob/ratio/reform_ratio.rb) that will create figures of the best permutation's snp ratio distribution across the genome, and the performance of the algorithm, with regard to the increase of fitness for each generation.

### Next

1. Unit tests

2. MAke code better with Martin

2. GA:
 - See what the correlation value is, and write this into the README and any future mention of it: r2 pearsons?
 - Consider looking at the best recombinant, mutant and save in each generation to see which of these is contributing to the best
 - Generate some kind of visual representation of the best permutation's similarity to original order (ask about this)
 
3. Remember to also do **Calculus** and **Classes/unit-test practice**

3. Look at basecamp for main list

### Eventually

1. Make it so the algorithm works for argument datasets and saves output files in appropriate locations

1. Make the algorithm super neat, use classes where appropriate. Can do this for model generation script too.

2. Use rdoc, and do documentation for key ruby files.

3. Make a ruby gem
