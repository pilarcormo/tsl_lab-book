fragmented_genome_with_snps repo:
---------------------------------

>### commit
>- completed lr2 method and written up
>https://github.com/edwardchalstrey1/fragmented_genome_with_snps/commit/17578b793a9a0893af2dea73533e585699bb75bf

>## Today
>1. Continued coding and writing up rearrangement methods

>2. Updated the github README for this repo

>## Next
> - Run the l/r method on fasta order (as it is currently), then go back and order the left and right lists by density (individually). This is a maybe as it will be very time consuming and not neccesarily worth the effort

> - Come up with other new methods for rearranging the fragments by snp density, then test them

> - When finished with rearrangement methods, export an array of the scores (and method names) to file, that can be loaded into the bar plot in R Studio

> - Put in mathematical summary of ordinal similarity

> - Put in highest value of ordinal similarity score

>## Also you could...
>1. Put the methods from each working file into classes?

>2. Write an extra method in fragments_w_snps.rb that tests whether the snp positions are really in a normal distribution
