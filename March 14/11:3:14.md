========================================================

### Today

- Algorithm has run until end
- Made figures of metrics over generations
- Tested non-parametric correlations for the Q-Q plot: concluded that pearsons is better, but that Q-Q plot of the ratio density as we are doing is not good

### Next

2. Make the model genome have uniform heterozygous SNPs: this should give a normal distribution (make it a definite normal distribution for this test)
 - We can use qqnorm, rather than qqplot against the input distribution
 - Real SNP distribution data can come later when we can get it to work like this
 
2. Run the algorithm again with new dataset and fitness method

3. If this works, then we can write up that the genetic algorithm idea works, with a fitness method that used the hom/het snp density ratio
 - ... then, it will be a case of finding a suitable distibution approximation for the Q-Q plot with real data

### Eventually

2. Parallelize the algorithm: perhaps use the parallel gem
 - **No need to worry about this until after you have the fitness method that really works!**
 - This will probably only be neccesary if you want to run it in the cluster

6. Understand maths behind peak finding, and use peak finding in R: add to GA

7. Update README further with the "Purpose of Project" and "Peak Finding" sections

2. Use rdoc, and do documentation for key ruby files.

3. Make ruby **gems** for the project: GATOC and permutation metrics
