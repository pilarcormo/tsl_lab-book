done error bars, started scatta plotz
https://github.com/edwardchalstrey1/fragmented_genome_with_snps/commit/b371c2635c6437349eaf1770f7740f4e5559aa6c

## Today

- Added error bars to the bar plot on the random control

- Started working on the scatter plots for each method: I have imported a hash of frag ids with their associated densities as values into rearrangement_methods.rb. 

## Scatter Plots

- Sort the density values for each of the rearrangement methods, including 'left' and 'right' lists

- Export lists of the frag ids and their associated densities in the same order, for each rearrangement method, into R

- Make scatter plots from the above lists, with density on the y axis

## Next

- Look at the answer to your question on stack, and decide what to do about determining the highest possible score. Then write up.

- Use 'write latex'/'mac latex' for making the ord sim **maths png**, then insert this into the markdown

- Use a **qq plot** to test normal distribution of sampled snp positions in fragments_w_snps.rb

- Come up with **new rearrangement methods**

- Make **bar plot** neater and rename the png with an informative filename: don't worry about this until you are finished with rearrangement methods, as putting the file into the correct place then commiting to github for every change would be a hassle.

## Later on...

- Way down the line: test different midpoints for your rearranged distribution to be around; this could be after you already have a rearrangement method that works when we know the midpoint is in the middle. Write a method that uses that rearrangement method multiple times, with different midpoints, to find the best one, and therefore estimate the mutant position.
