### This week

I now have unit tests for the ruby lib files in fragmented_genome_with_snps repo (ratio branch).
The ModelGenome and ReformRatio classes from the lib files can be called in a script to create a model genome and re-order contigs respectively.

### Next

1. Separate ReformRatio class from genetic algorithm class

1. Refactor lib files as much as possible

2. See what the correlation value is, and write this into the README and any future mention of it: r2 pearsons?

3. Consider looking at the best recombinant, mutant and save in each generation to see which of these is contributing to the best

4. Generate some kind of visual representation of the best permutation's similarity to original order (ask about this)
 
5. Get the GA to work for a variety of distributions (and fragment sizes)

### Eventually

6. Understand maths behind peak finding, and use peak finding in R: add to GA

7. Update README further with the "Purpose of Project" and "Peak Finding" sections

2. Use rdoc, and do documentation for key ruby files.

3. Make ruby gems for the project, a simple class with things like write_txt, my own genetic algorithm?
