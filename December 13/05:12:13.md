========================================================

**From now on, each day after tea break do some work on literature review OR read calculus/statistics R**

### Today

- started sorting a ggplot 2 histogram in skew scatta (how scatta)

- Did a little bit of lit review SNP calling section

### Next

1. Try and work out why exactly the centre of the normal dist is not where the mutation is
 - This may not be a real problem, but generate datasets of equal frag size to check
 
2. use ggplot to confirm that skew method is shit. Do plots like the the how_scatta ones I did, but with a "jittered" y axis scatter, or density plot, or whatever
 - + geom_histogram, density...

3. Then really make the model genome accurate
 - ngm paper: not just SNPs, **homozygous SNPs**, look for an appropriate standard deviation

4. AND THEN try and get a rearrangement method/ mutation detection algorithm

2. Read other papers for the SNP calling mapping based/background section, lit review

3. Possibly: use rdoc, and do documentation for key ruby files, but need to classify them first

### Later on

2. Make a better rearrangement method: linear programming?

3. Test different midpoints for your rearranged distribution to be around; this could be after you already have a rearrangement method that works when we know the midpoint is in the middle. Write a method that uses that rearrangement method multiple times, with different midpoints, to find the best one, and therefore estimate the mutant position.

4. Eventually you will need to modify density_method_testa.rb to work with any ARGV file, and of course the file containing the rearrangement/mutation locating algorithm, saving the files in an appropriate location
